# Visual Facts
The aim of VisualFacts is to develop a scalable platform for providing self-service visual analytic capabilities to a wide range of corporate and non-corporate users to access, explore, analyze open and privately-held data and collaborate on the analytic results of their work by sharing, annotating and reusing them in the form of visual facts.
